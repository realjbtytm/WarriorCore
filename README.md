# WarriorCore

## What is this plugin for?
This is for the McWars Network. It handles all the basics of the network. Without it, McWars would not function properly.

## Why is it open-sourced.
Due to that Github is great for the workflow, and that we can't afford a private repository. It is also due to we want players and staff members and developers alike to make this core.
